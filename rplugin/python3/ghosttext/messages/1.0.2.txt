SublimeTextArea has become GhostText for Sublime Text
=====================================================

Syntax detection by host name has been changed, now only the base name like "PHP.tmLanguage" is needed.
If a not installed syntax like "Foo.tmLanguage" gets specified you will get informed about it!

Usage
-----

In Chrome, when you're in a page with a plain-text field (<textarea>), click the GhostText button in the upper-right corner to open up Sublime Text. Everything you type in the editor will be instantly updated in the browser (and vice versa).

To close the link, either close the tab in Sublime Text or click on the GhostText button again.
