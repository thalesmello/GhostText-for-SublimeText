SublimeTextArea has become GhostText for Sublime Text
=====================================================

We put a lot of effort to bring you GhostText, a much more polished and solid experience to write in the browser with Sublime Text.

Don't forget to install the updated Chrome extension:

Usage
-----

In Chrome, when you're in a page with a plain-text field (<textarea>), click the GhostText button in the upper-right corner to open up Sublime Text. Everything you type in the editor will be instantly updated in the browser (and vice versa).

To close the link, either close the tab in Sublime Text or click on the GhostText button again.
